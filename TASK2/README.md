# Task 2 - BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator 

# Idea: Command-Line BMI Calculator
Project Description:

For Beginners: Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.
 
 What we get to undestand from this project:
- Function definitions
- Conditional logic
- Input validation
- Exception handling (`try-except`)
- Command-line interaction

# Features

-It accepts **weight (in kilograms)** and **height (in meters)** as user input.
- Calculates BMI using the formula:
  
  \[
  BMI = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}
  \]

-  It classifies the BMI into categories:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- Handles invalid or non-numeric input using `try-except`.
- Validates that weight and height are positive numbers.
- Runs directly from the command line.

# Technologies used are as follows

- A suitable python version
- Standard Python libraries
- No external dependencies required

# How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Save the script in a file (e.g., `task2.py`).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:

```bash
python task2.py
#That was all about my task 2 :)
