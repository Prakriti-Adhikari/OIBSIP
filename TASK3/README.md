# Random Password Generator
# Task 3
Idea: Random Password Generator

Description:
For Beginners: Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.


# Features

- We can select custom password length
- We can choose character types:
  - Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
  - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
  - Digits (`0-9`)
  - Symbols (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- Input validation
- User-friendly command-line interface

# Requirements

- A Suitable Python Version like Python 3
  No external libraries required (uses built-in `random` and `string` modules).

# How to Use

1. Save the script in a file named `task3.py`.

2. Run the script using the command line:
   ```bash
   python task3.py
# That was all about my task 3 :)
